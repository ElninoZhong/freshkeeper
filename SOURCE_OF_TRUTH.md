# Freshkeeper Source of Truth

Status: canonical path migration and Phase 4A safety hardening completed on 2026-07-18.

## Authority map

| Concern | Authoritative location | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Editable source | `/Users/elninozhong/Documents/Projects/freshkeeper` | All forward changes happen here. |
| Historical compatibility entry | `/Users/elninozhong/Documents/Claude/Projects/freshkeeper` | Symlink to the canonical source; never create a second checkout here. |
| Runtime config and logs | `FRESHKEEPER_HOME`, default `~/.freshkeeper` | Mutable local state; never commit it. |
| Shared user skills | `/Users/elninozhong/.agents/skills` | External canonical library; Freshkeeper may touch it only through an explicitly authorized, fail-closed update plan. |
| Project skill intent | The nearest valid `skills-lock.json`, or `FRESHKEEPER_SKILLS_CWD` | Missing or malformed lock never widens update scope. |
| Project rules | `AGENTS.md` | Shared rules for all agents. |
| Domain language | `CONTEXT.md` | Names update concepts and safety invariants. |
| Claude compatibility | `CLAUDE.md` | Thin pointer only. |
| Product behavior | `src/`, verified by `tests/` | Documentation follows implemented and tested behavior. |

## Migration state

- The repository moved atomically from the Claude project root to the canonical path on the same volume.
- Git history, remote, working-tree inode, ignored dependencies, and build output moved together; no second repository was created.
- The old path is a symlink so historical Claude/Codex cwd references and recovery links continue to resolve.
- `Documents/Codex` remains historical runtime/archive material and is not a Freshkeeper project root.

## Maintenance rule

Never silently change the canonical path, broaden skill update scope, bypass `enabledAdapters`, rewrite unrelated crontab entries, or publish from a tag whose package state has not been verified.
